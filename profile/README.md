### Welcome to Aureus Development!
We are a small group of designers and developers from around the world that have come together to maintain some projects that have lost their core teams. In an effort to not let these great plugins die, we offer modern version updates and limited bug support on modern Minecraft versions.

If you are interested in joining our team, are a developer that wants to hand a project over to be maintained, or have a request for a project to be maintained, please send an email to **realmofaureus@gmail.com**. We look forward to hearing from you!

### Want to help support our cause? 
Drop us a dollar using Github Sponsor! Every dollar we take in goes towards improving the quality and scope of code we produce, paying our hard-working team, and helps support the Realm of Aureus network.
